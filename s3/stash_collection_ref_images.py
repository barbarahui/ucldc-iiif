""" Note to self: this will eventually be a script that's part of the UCLDC harvester's 'harvest images' logic. It will kick off harvesting of nuxeo master image files. Part of that process will be conversion of nuxeo image files into jp2000s, which will be stashed on S3 somewhere. Per convo with Brian, we probably want to keep track of which images have been stashed somewhere. Maybe in a dynamoDB on AWS? Other option is existing couchdb that's part of harvester, but that may not be as easy to maintain, and we might be switching out that infrastructure eventually """
